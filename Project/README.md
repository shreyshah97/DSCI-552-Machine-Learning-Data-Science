## Instruction on how to run

1. Open google colab and upload `notebook/Shah_Shrey_Project.ipynb`.
2. Create a folder in the same gmail account's drive with a name `MLDS`. Make sure this folder is just under a folder `MyDrive`.
3. Then create a directory within `MLDS` called `Project`.
4. Upload `data` folder inside the `Project` directory.
5. File structure should look like this:

```
MyDrive
    - MLDS
        - Project
            - data
                - Data
                    - Sport Images
                    - Sport Videos
                - Pre-trained Weights
                - Stats
            - notebook
                - Shah_Shrey_Project.ipynb
```

6. You can run the code from the ipynb file. (You can use pre-trained weights or train these models from scratch!)
